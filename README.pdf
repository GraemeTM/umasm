/* * * * * * * * * * Correctly Implemented * * * * * * * * * */
Our code matches the reference for tests up to a million instructions 
so it is correct to our knowledge.

/* * * * * * * * * * Print Module * * * * * * * * * */

In a loop we pushed each digit of the number onto a stack using the mod 
and division operators, then popped them off the stack and printed 
them at the end. 

/* * * * * * * * * * Value Stack * * * * * * * * * */

We allocated space for a stack and stored the address in r3, and we also
kept track of the size of the stack in a separately allocated word
so we could check if operations were possible.
    
/* * * * * * * * * * Sections * * * * * * * * * */

init- Used for setting registers r6, r7 as temps,
r0 as 0, initializing jump table, setting r2 and r3 to 
callstack and value stack addresses.
stk- Allocating memory for call stack, value stack, and
stack for print digits.
data- Allocate space for value counter. 
rodata- Allocate space for jumptable. 
text- Used for main program code and functions.
